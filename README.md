12 months of experiments
========================

For 2013 I decided to play with JavaScript by creating "something" every month.
The point is not to create a pefect program. It is simply to practice and increase my comfort level and speed of thinking about a problem.
My goal is to practice the DRY principle, Single Responsibility Principle and use best practices whenever possible.
I pick existing ideas or games to avoid scope creeping.
There is also a time limit of one month regardless of the state of the program so don't hate if it sucks! :D
